* Core Questions / Hypothesis
** Reduced violence combo game
** Semantic combos
* Plan of attack
** DONE Character placeholders
** DONE Detect button combo
** DONE Trigger basic attack
** DONE Damaging
need a health script
How to manage not hitting twice w/ same part of the attack?
** DONE meal attacks (match & display)
Attacks start before combos are fully known. Is this a tree of attacks?
Animation, hitbox (w/ anim?), damage / effect
** DONE List some meals into system
** DONE Controller Support

** Convert to 2D
*** DONE Sprites are done!
*** DONE Update scripts for 2D colliders (hit and hurtbox)
*** DONE Need to reattach scripts to Rebecca object
*** [Done for now] Make animations for different foods
Hitbox location and activity
Save cool particles and junk for later!
*** Make enemy objects
** DONE Base Movement (w/ anim)
** DONE Controlled movement
** DONE AI movement (dumb follow)
** DONE AI attack

** Juicier
quicker animations
flashing
Attack area indication, splatter or swinging
Directional knockback

** attack differentiation
damage
effect, e.g. knockback amount?

** courses

* TODO Fix
** Combo delay is too short for some long attacks
Start combo delay from the animations?
Also should eat input from the early part of long combos
And delay display of the meal name
** Trigger Attack end for Rebecca
use animation events to let the FoodFighter know we can stop updating the attack

* Maybe later
** enemy health bars
** player GUI
** knockback, hitstop
** attack interrupt

* Cutting room floor
** Item loss system
** Navmesh enemies
** attack visual effects
** buffs and debuffs
** aoe
** passive aoe
** rooms / dungeon crawling
** room decor
** cinematics
** inventory system
** Dragon chase
** Boss fight
** puzzles & challenges

** Node editor & Tree of moves
